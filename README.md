TO USE:

Put .csv file from rocket flight into RocketSim/datafiles folder. Open RocketSim.yyp in Gamemaker and run to simulate flight in 2D.

If generating test data, run test_flight_data_generator.py in local Python compiler. Move generated file from Users/\[whatever your username is\] directory to the same datafiles folder. Before running, open the .csv file up in Notepad and remove the first row which has headers for all the data values.

Use middle mouse to pan, scroll wheel to go in and out.

COMING NEXT RELEASE:
- New camera mode (track trajectory and unlock camera from rocket!)
- Resource mode (optimized so it doesn't lag and cap at like five times slomo!)
- Angular jet trails!

FOR OUR PATREON SUPPORTERS: 
- Adds usability (now you can actually run it via .exe!)
